# Functionality

Since patches with generated serial numbers do not last permanently on the boots, it was decided to mark them only with a consecutive number using a permanent marker.  
The template “Stiefel_&lt;sequential number>” is selected for this purpose.  
The script extracts the `sequential number` and prints the next usable one.

## Execution

1. Execute the script with the button `Ermittle nächste freie Stiefel Nummer` on the following page:
   - Bestandsübersicht / Ausgabe - https://www.firemanager.de/portal/kkleiderkammers

2. The result gets printed on the screen
